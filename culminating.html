<h1>Culminating Assignment</h1>
<p>I built a simple circuit to explore how fingerprint sensors and phone screens might work. The main part of my circuit has two copper wires. When something that conducts electricity touches both wires at the same time, it completes the circuit and lights up an LED. This helps me understand how devices can detect touch or the presence of a finger.

I chose copper wire because it's a good conductor and easy to work with. The LED serves as a clear visual indicator when the circuit is complete. This project taught me about basic electrical conductivity and how simple sensors can be made.

As a side project, I also experimented with a small traffic light setup, which was another interesting way to learn about circuits and programming lights.

This hands-on experience has really helped me understand the conepts we learned in class and further improve my understanding.</p>
