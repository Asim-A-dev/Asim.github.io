# About

This course has taught me a lot about how electronics and coding come together to solve real-world problems. My understanding of how devices work has expanded, and I am excited about where this knowledge can take me.

I came into this course with limited experience but have already learned so much about circuits, logic gates, and basic coding skills.

## Improvements

Through hands-on projects and consistent effort, Iâ€™ve significantly improved my problem-solving skills and learned how to troubleshoot real-world systems effectively.
