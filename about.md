<h2>About Me and My Journey in the Course</h2>
<p>When I first started this course, I had little knowledge about electronics and circuits. But over time, I have learned so much and developed skills in areas like circuit building, binary digits, logic gates, and much more. I have worked on various projects, such as building a night light and a traffic light system, and I've even learned how to use TinkerCAD and Linux!</p>
