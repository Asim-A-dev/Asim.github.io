# About Me

When I started this course, I didn’t know what to expect. Over time, I’ve learned a lot, from building circuits in TinkerCAD to using Linux and GitHub. The course has expanded my understanding of technology and circuits.

### **The Future**
As I continue to learn and improve, I plan to further my knowledge in electronics, programming, and systems design. The skills I’ve gained here will be invaluable in my future endeavors.
