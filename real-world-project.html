<h1>Real World Project</h1>
<p>I built a smart night light that turns on automatically when it's dark and detects movement. Here's how it works:

The night light has three main parts:
1. A motion sensor that spots when someone is moving nearby
2. A photoresistor that can tell if it's dark or light in the room
3. A switch that lets you turn the whole system on or off

When the switch is on, the night light checks two things:
- Is it dark enough? (using the photoresistor)
- Is there movement? (using the motion sensor)

If both conditions are met - it's dark and there's movement - the light turns on. This means it only lights up when someone needs it, saving energy.

I used an LED for the light because it's bright but doesn't use much power. The whole system is connected to a small circuit board that controls when the light should turn on or off.

This project taught me how to combine different sensors and switches to create a useful, automated device. It's cool to see how these simple parts can work together to make something that's actually helpful in everyday life..</p>
