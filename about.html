<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Asim Ashfaq, a 15-year-old from Karachi, Pakistan. In 2016, I moved to Canada from Saudi Arabia. When I started this computer science course, I wasn't sure what to expect. I've always been interested in technology, and this was my first related high school class.

As the course went on, I learned important skills like Linux, Boolean Logic, and Circuits. I even built my own automated night light. Now, as the course ends, I'm proud of how much I've learned and grown in something I really love.<p>
