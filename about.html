<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Asim Ashfaq, I was born in Karachi, Pakistan and am 15 years old. I moved to Canada from Saudi Arabia in 2016 and have lived here veer since. When I started this course I didn't know what to expect, I had alwayas had an interest in computer related stuff and this was my first high school class related to it. But as the course progressed, I learned valuable skills such as Linux, Boolean Logic, Circuits, and much more.As the course progressed I only got better and better even building my own automated night light. As this course comes to an end, I take time to reflect how much I've grown as a person and how I've improved my skills on something I love dearly.<p>
